# Detailed Report: AI Use Case Generation for the Automotive Industry

## Project Title: AI Use Case Generation System for the Automotive Industry

### Methodology:
This project leverages a multi-agent architecture system designed to generate relevant AI and Generative AI (GenAI) use cases for the Automotive Industry. The primary goals are to conduct market research, generate use cases, identify resource assets, and recommend GenAI applications that can enhance operational efficiency and customer experiences.

### System Architecture:

The system is composed of four main agents, each responsible for a different task. These agents are orchestrated to work sequentially to produce a final, comprehensive report:

#### 1. ResearchAgent:

- **Objective:** Conduct industry research by retrieving trends and identifying key competitors in the automotive sector.
- **Method:** Utilizes Google Custom Search API to gather information on industry trends and top competitors in real time.
- **Output:** Lists of current industry trends and notable competitors in the automotive sector, used to contextualize and prioritize the generated AI use cases.

#### 2.UseCaseAgent:

- **Objective:** Generate relevant AI use cases specific to the automotive industry.
- **Method:** Uses industry trends and competitor insights from the ResearchAgent to create industry-specific AI and GenAI use cases.
- **Output:** AI use cases that are prioritized based on feasibility, including brief descriptions and references to trends or competitor activities for each use case.

#### 3.ResourceAgent:

- **Objective:** Find data resources and datasets related to each generated use case.
- **Method:** Searches Kaggle and HuggingFace datasets related to the AI use cases generated, providing resource links for each use case.
- **Output:** A list of dataset links from Kaggle and HuggingFace, saved in ```resource_links.md```, ensuring that the necessary data resources are available for each use case.

#### 4.GenAIRecommendationAgent:

- **Objective:** Recommend GenAI solutions for internal and customer-facing applications.
- **Method:** Based on industry trends, it suggests GenAI solutions, such as chatbots for customer service and document search applications.
- **Output:** GenAI recommendations, tailored to the automotive industry, saved in ```report.md```.

**Overall Workflow:** The agents are orchestrated sequentially, beginning with the ResearchAgent gathering industry insights, followed by the UseCaseAgent, which leverages this information to generate prioritized use cases. The ResourceAgent then searches for relevant datasets, and finally, the GenAIRecommendationAgent provides actionable GenAI recommendations. All outputs are compiled into markdown files, ```report.md``` and ```resource_links.md```.


### Architecture Flowchart:

Below is the flowchart illustrating the architecture and data flow between agents:

```

### Results:
The final output includes two markdown files:

1. report.md:

   - Contains a detailed industry analysis report with:
        - **Industry Trends:** Key trends in the automotive sector.
        - **Competitors:** Major competitors in the industry.
        - **Generated Use Cases:** AI/GenAI use cases tailored to the automotive industry, with feasibility rankings and dataset links.
        - **GenAI Solution Recommendations:** Recommended GenAI solutions for customer support and internal operations.

2. resource_links.md:

   - Contains a list of dataset links for each use case, providing the necessary resources for implementing these use cases.

### Conclusion:

This project successfully demonstrates how a multi-agent architecture can be used to automatically generate AI use cases, identify relevant resources, and provide actionable GenAI recommendations. The generated use cases are specific to the automotive industry, with feasible, prioritized recommendations that leverage recent trends and competitor activities.

By integrating Google Custom Search API and popular dataset sources, this system offers a comprehensive, real-time analysis tool for any industry. The multi-agent approach can be applied to other sectors to generate AI-driven insights, optimize operations, and enhance customer experiences.
